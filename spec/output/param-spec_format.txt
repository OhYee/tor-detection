This file lists the recognized parameters that can appear on the "params" line of a directory consensus.

1. Network protocol parameters
 "circwindow" -- the default package window that circuits should be established with. It started out at 1000 cells, but some research indicates that a lower value would mean fewer cells in transit in the network at any given time.
    Min: 100, Max: 1000
    First-appeared: Tor 0.2.1.20
 "refuseunknownexits" -- if set to one, exit relays look at the previous hop of circuits that ask to open an exit stream, and refuse to exit if they don't recognize it as a relay. The goal is to make it harder for people to use them as one-hop proxies. See trac entry 1751 for details.
    Min: 0, Max: 1
    First-appeared: 0.2.2.17-alpha
 "UseOptimisticData" -- If set to zero, clients by default shouldn't try to send optimistic data to servers until they have received a
    RELAY_CONNECTED cell.
    Min: 0, Max: 1, Default: 1
    First-appeared: 0.2.3.3-alpha
    Default was 0 before: 0.2.9.1-alpha
    Removed in 0.4.5.1-alpha; now always on.
 "usecreatefast" -- Used to control whether clients use the CREATE_FAST handshake on the first hop of their circuits.
    Min: 0, Max: 1. Default: 1.
    First-appeared: 0.2.4.23, 0.2.5.2-alpha
    Removed in 0.4.5.1-alpha; now always off.
 "min_paths_for_circs_pct" -- A percentage threshold that determines whether clients believe they have enough directory information to build circuits.  This value applies to the total fraction of bandwidth-weighted paths that the client could build; see path-spec.txt for more information.
    Min: 25, Max: 95, Default: 60
    First-appeared: 0.2.4
 "AllowNonearlyExtend" -- If true, permit EXTEND cells that are not inside
    RELAY_EARLY cells.
    Min: 0. Max: 1. Default: 0.
    First-appeared: 0.2.3.11-alpha

    Min: 0. Max: 1. Default: 0.
    First-appeared: 0.3.0


2. Performance-tuning parameters
 "CircuitPriorityHalflifeMsec" -- the halflife parameter used when weighting which circuit will send the next cell. Obeyed by Tor
    0.2.2.10-alpha and later.  (Versions of Tor between 0.2.2.7-alpha and
    0.2.2.10-alpha recognized a "CircPriorityHalflifeMsec" parameter, but mishandled it badly.)
    Min: -1, Max: 2147483647 (INT32_MAX)
    First-appeared: Tor 0.2.2.11-alpha
 "perconnbwrate" and "perconnbwburst" -- if set, each relay sets up a separate token bucket for every client OR connection, and rate limits that connection indepedently. Typically left unset, except when used for performance experiments around trac entry 1750. Only honored by relays running Tor 0.2.2.16-alpha and later. (Note that relays running
    0.2.2.7-alpha through 0.2.2.14-alpha looked for bwconnrate and bwconnburst, but then did the wrong thing with them; see bug 1830 for details.)
    Min: 1, Max: 2147483647 (INT32_MAX)
    First-appeared: 0.2.2.7-alpha
    Removed-in: 0.2.2.16-alpha
 "NumNTorsPerTAP" -- When balancing ntor and TAP cells at relays, how many ntor handshakes should we perform for each TAP handshake?

    First-appeared: 0.2.4.11-alpha
 "FastFlagMinThreshold", "FastFlagMaxThreshold" -- lowest and highest allowable values for the cutoff for routers that should get the Fast flag.  This is used during voting to prevent the threshold for getting the Fast flag from being too low or too high.
    FastFlagMinThreshold: Min: 4. Max: INT32_MAX: Default: 4.
    FastFlagMaxThreshold: Min: -. Max: INT32_MAX: Default: INT32_MAX
    First-appeared: 0.2.3.11-alpha

 "onion-key-grace-period-days" -- (min 1, max onion-key-rotation-days, default 7)

    Every relay should list each onion key it generates for onion-key-rotation-days days after generating it, and then replace it.  Relays should continue to accept their most recent previous onion key for an additional onion-key-grace-period-days days after it is replaced.  (Introduced in 0.3.1.1-alpha; prior versions of tor hardcoded both of these values to 7 days.)
